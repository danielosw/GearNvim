 > Install requires Neovim 0.10+.

A Nvim config thats designed around customizability  
You will need cmake, ripegrep, yarn and fzf (and possibly more that I don't remember).  
Note that one of the plugins is a personal fork of nvim-lightbulb.  
Also note that this is entirly tested on Windows and Linux, so due to some file path stuff it may not work on mac/bsd.  
As well, despite using Lazy.nvim this is not using LazyVim, or any other distribution for that matter.
