# TODO

- Do more optimising
    - Do more lazy loading
    - Replace dropbar
        - Maybe switch to navic. I can't get it to work but it seems good.
    - Remove unused things
        - Make sure dressing is actually needed.

- Finish reorganizing
    - Move things in plugins.lua to other files.
